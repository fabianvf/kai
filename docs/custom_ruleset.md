This documentation has moved to the
[editor-extensions](https://github.com/konveyor/editor-extensions) repository.

See the [extension README](https://github.com/konveyor/editor-extensions/blob/main/vscode/core/README.md)
for custom rules management, and the
[analyzer-lsp rules documentation](https://github.com/konveyor/analyzer-lsp/blob/main/docs/rules.md)
for creating rules and rulesets.
